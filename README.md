API and Utilities for Working with IHO S-100 HDF5 Data Formats

Overview
--------

This python package includes an API and utilities for encoding hydrographic
datasets in the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S-100
HDF5 format.

See [s100py Read the Docs](https://s100py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

Background
----------

The IHO S-100 standard is a data framework for digital products and
services for hydrographic, maritime, and GIS communities, comprised of
multiple data encoding formats designed for interoperability with
Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs).

This package includes the following S-100 encoding formats:

-   S-102 Bathymetric Surface 
-   S-104 Water Level Information for Surface Navigation
-   S-111 Water Currents for Surface Navigation

However, support for additional formats as they become available will
be added in the future.  For further information about S-100 formats,
see the [IHO website](http://s100.iho.int/S100/).

Create S100 Products
--------------------

- Follow [S-102](https://s100py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/s102.html#) examples to create an S-102 File
- Follow [S-104](https://s100py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/s104.html#) examples to create an S-104 File
- Follow [S-111](https://s100py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/s111.html#) examples to create an S-111 File

Requirements
------------

This codebase is written for Python 3 and relies on the following python
packages:

-   h5py
-   numpy
-   gdal


Installation
------------

This package requires the GDAL Python bindings be present, so it usually can\'t 
just be installed using `pip install gdal`. We recommend installing GDAL 
either through a package manager (e.g. `conda`, `apt`, `yum`, `pacman`) 
or by compiling from scratch. [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 
is probably the easiest method.

Once `gdal` has been installed, s100py can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install s100py==1.0.0
```

Release Notes
-------------
**Version 1.0.0 (2023-10-27)**
- This is a major release, which includes several new APIs that encapsulate the latest S-100 standard (S-100 Edition 5.0.0)
and S-100 Product Specifications (S-102 Edition 2.2.0, S-111 Edition 1.2.0, S-104 Edition 1.1.0) and adds support for
multiple S-100 Editions and Product Specification versions
- Additional convenience utilities have been added to generate:
  * S-102 Edition 2.1.0 & 2.2.0 datasets
  * S-111 Edition 1.0.0 & 1.2.0 datasets
  * S-104 Edition 1.0.0 & 1.1.0 datasets
  * S-102 Data Coding Format 9 (Feature Oriented Regular Grid) datasets
  * S-104 Data Coding Format 3 (Irregular Grid) datasets
  * S-104 Data Coding Format 7 (TIN) datasets
- S-102 Edition 2.1.0 (S-100 Edition 4.0) significant changes include:
    * The depth orientation has changed from positive up to positive down
- S-102 Edition 2.2.0 (S-100 Edition 5.0) significant changes include:
    * General metadata _horizontalDatumReference_ and _horizontalDatumValue_ have been removed
    * General metadata attributes _horizontalCRS_ and _typeOfHorizontalCRS_ were added
    * Stricter datatypes have been set for all attributes
    * Added the feature attribute table _QualityOfSurvey_ which provides the following additional survey metadata:
      * The categorization of the assessment level of bathymetric data for an area
      * If the least depth of detected features in an area was measured
      * If significant features have or have not been detected in the course of a survey
      * The size of detected bathymetric features in an area
      * Percentage of depth that a feature of such size could be detected
      * If full seafloor coverage has been achieved in the area by hydrographic surveys
      * Flag for bathy coverage nodes populated by interpolation
      * The best estimate of the fixed horizontal or vertical accuracy component for positions, depths, heights, vertical
      distances, and vertical clearances
      * The factor to be applied to the variable component of uncertainty equation to provide the best estimate of the
      variable horizontal or vertically accuracy component for positions, depths, heights, vertical distances, and
      vertical clearances
      * The start date of the period of the hydrographic survey
      * The end date of the period of the hydrographic survey
      * The survey filename or ID
      * The authority which as responsible for the hydrographic survey
      * An estimate of the magnitude of the difference between true and estimated bathymetric depth, after all appropriate
      corrections are made
- S-111 Edition 1.2.0 (S-100 Edition 5.0.0) significant changes include:
  * General metadata _horizontalDatumReference_ and _horizontalDatumValue_ have been removed
  * General metadata attributes _horizontalCRS_ and _typeOfHorizontalCRS_ were added
  * Stricter datatypes have been set for all attributes
  * General metadata attribute _depthTypeIndex_ has been modified to only allow _heightOrDepth_ or _layerAverage_
  * General metadata _datasetDeliveryInterval_ was added, describing the expected time interval between availability of
  successive datasets for time-varying data, formatted as an ISO 8601 duration (e.g. 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS')
  * The enumeration attribute for the classification of data according the relationship between the time of its collection,
  generation or calculation of generation parameters, in relation the time of publication has been changed from
  _typeOfCurrentData_ to _dataDynamicity_
- S-104 Edition 1.1.0 (S-100 Edition 5.0.0) significant changes include:
  * General metadata _horizontalDatumReference_ and _horizontalDatumValue_ have been removed

  * Stricter datatypes have been set for all attributes
  * General metadata _datasetDeliveryInterval_ was added, describing the expected time interval between availability of
  successive datasets for time-varying data, formatted as an ISO 8601 duration (e.g. 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS')

  generation or calculation of generation parameters, in relation the time of publication has been changed from
  _typeOfWaterLevelData_ to _dataDynamicity_
  * General metadata _trendInterval_ was added, describing the interval in minutes over which trend at a particular time
  is calculated

**Version 1.0.0-rc.1 (2021-02-11)**
- This is a major release, which includes a new API that encapsulates the data specifications to allow
  introspection with Python to determine what data is available or should be and what data types would
  be acceptable. Convenience utilities are available to convert data into S102/S104/S111 so detailed
  knowledge of the S100 specs and APIs is not required in most cases
- Support for s102 (bathymetry) and s104 (water levels) has been added
- A consistent API for S100 data structures was added and is used to encode S102, S104, and S111
- The previous S111 library has been migrated to this general S100 API and therefore any
  code written against the previous s100py library will no longer work
- Examples of using the new S111 API are available [here](https://s100py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/s111.html#example-usage)
